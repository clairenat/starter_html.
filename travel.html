Dublin was originally a Viking settlement called Dubh Linn which translates to black pool. Dublin has always been a historically significant city in Irish history, from being the main city from which the British ruled over Ireland for 800 years to then being the setting of the 1916 Easter Rising and Irish War of Independence.  </p>
            </div>
            <p>Today Dublin is a developed city boasting one of the strongest tech sectors in Europe and a booming tourism industry. Dublin is renowned for its sites such as the GPO, Croke Park, O'Connell Street, Temple Bar and Saint James Gate, which is where Guinness is brewed. Dublin is also surrounded by great coastal towns such as Dun Laoghaire, Howth and Skerries.</p>

            <p class="headprecipe">The national capital of Italy remains a historical and political hub today. Nicknamed the “Eternal City,” Rome is considered the origination of the Catholic Church and Roman civilization central to the development of the Western World. Divided into 22 walled rioni (districts) surrounded by 35 quartieri urbani (urban sectors) that are surrounded by 6 large suburbi (suburbs), the city, just larger than New York City at an area of 496 mi2,  is home to 2.8 million residents. Its economy runs on the tourism and services industries, the latter mostly in government jobs.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Via del Corso, named after Roman carnival horse races, is the main street that runs through Rome. Many significant churches, palaces, and squares run along this road (Piazza del Popolo, and the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna, for example). The seven hills that surround Rome are trenched with mythological history which can be seen through the prevalence of temples. Must see landmarks for those traveling include the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and Catacombs. St. Peter’s Square & Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, technically located within Vatican City – an independent city-state within Rome – are also worth a visit.</p>
